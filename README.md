# OrderSystem

Order Management System was a dummy project I built during my internship as a Software Development Intern at [NetMeds.com](https://www.netmeds.com/)

Order Management System is a system that processes orders and provides the expected response on different endpoints. 
The project's scope was to learn about backend development by considering the REST API principles. 
Learned how to manage the inventory using a dummy database. Java and Spring Boot were the main frameworks that define this project. 
Created controllers and service classes and performed required dependency injection to make the most use of Spring Boot. 
Understood the basic CRUD operations that can be made while working in the backend environment. 
Finally tested the system on POSTMAN to understand the request-response cycle to intercept various design values while developing a Spring Boot project.
